# Football Players React App ⚽

A responsive and interactive React application that displays a list of football players using **React-Bootstrap** cards. Each player card shows details like name, team, nationality, jersey number, age, and image. Clicking a card opens a modal with a larger view of the player's image.

The app is styled with a football field green theme, floating card effects, and a stylish title font.

- Player.js → Player card component with modal and hover float effect.

- PlayersList.js → Maps through the player array and displays cards in a responsive grid.

- players.js → Array of player objects with name, team, nationality, jersey number, age, and image URL.

## Styling Notes

- **Header:**  
  Uses the _Orbitron_ font, bold, italic, with a green background matching the football field theme.

- **Cards:**

  - Green-themed with `rgba` backgrounds to match the field.
  - Hover effect using `transform: translateY(-10px)` and `box-shadow`.
  - Card images use `object-fit: cover` to maintain proper aspect ratio.

- **Layout:**
  - Bootstrap `Container` + `Row` + `Col` with `g-4` for consistent gaps.
  - Responsive breakpoints (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`) ensure cards wrap naturally.
  - Bottom padding ensures the last row is fully visible without scrolling issues.
